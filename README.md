# Pattern Recognition Master

Pattern Recognition Master is a custom pattern detection indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on previous versions and modifications by Carl Sanders, Jason Robinson, and Hartono Setiono for MetaTrader 4. The indicator displays detected Japanese candlesticks patterns in form of small arrows and text labels.

Pattern Recognition Master can detect up to 14 classic candlestick patterns and issue alerts when a new pattern is spotted.
